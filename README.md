# 🧪 Task 4: Logistic Regression - Binary Classification

This project is part of the **AI & ML Internship Task 4**.  
The objective is to build a **Binary Classifier** using **Logistic Regression** and evaluate it with proper metrics.

---

## 📌 Objective
- Implement Logistic Regression for classification  
- Evaluate with **Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall, ROC-AUC**  
- Understand the **Sigmoid function** and decision threshold  

---

## 📂 Dataset
We use the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**.  
- Available in **Scikit-learn** directly  
- Also available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

---

## 🚀 Implementation Steps
1. Import and preprocess the dataset  
2. Train-test split and standardize features  
3. Train a **Logistic Regression model**  
4. Predict outcomes and probabilities  
5. Evaluate performance using:
   - Confusion Matrix  
   - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)  
   - ROC-AUC Curve  

---

## 📊 Results
- Confusion matrix heatmap  
- ROC curve with AUC score  
- Classification report with precision, recall, F1  

---

## 🖼️ Sample Visualizations
- **Confusion Matrix Heatmap**  
- **ROC Curve**

## 📝 Interview Questions Covered
1. How does logistic regression differ from linear regression?  
2. What is the sigmoid function?  
3. What is precision vs recall?  
4. What is the ROC-AUC curve?  
5. What is the confusion matrix?  
6. What happens if classes are imbalanced?  
7. How do you choose the threshold?  
8. Can logistic regression be used for multi-class problems?
